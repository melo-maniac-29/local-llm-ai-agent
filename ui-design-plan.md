3. Build interactive prototype for user testing
4. Implement component library based on finalized designs

## Implementation Approach
1. Set up design system and component library
2. Implement authentication flow
3. Build chat-centric interface with basic AI responses
4. Develop tool connection management system
5. Implement individual tool integrations starting with core planning features
6. Add advanced features like collaboration and mobile optimization
7. Polish with animations and transitions

## Development Priorities
1. Core chat interface with Ollama integration
2. Basic planning functionality with task generation
3. Convex database integration for persistence
4. Tool connection management UI
5. Calendar integration and visualization
6. Additional tool integrations
7. Mobile optimization and progressive enhancements

## Technical Architecture Considerations
