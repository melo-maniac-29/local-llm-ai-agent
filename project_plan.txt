# ü§ñ AI Planning Assistant - Project Analysis & Implementation Guide

## Project Overview
This project creates an **Intelligent AI Planning Assistant** that converts natural language goals into structured weekly plans. The system leverages three key technologies:

- **Next.js**: A React framework for building the full-stack application interface
- **Convex**: A real-time backend database with built-in sync capabilities
- **LM Studio**: A local large language model runner for AI processing without cloud dependencies

The planning assistant will enable users to input their goals in natural language and receive an organized weekly schedule. By keeping the AI processing local with LM Studio, we maintain privacy and reduce operational costs.

## System Architecture Understanding

### Core Components Interaction
1. **User Interface (Next.js)**: Collects user goals and displays generated plans
2. **Backend Processing (Convex)**: Stores tasks and manages data persistence
3. **AI Processing (LM Studio)**: Transforms natural language goals into structured tasks
4. **Integration Layer**: Connects the planning system with external calendars and tools

This architecture allows for separation of concerns while maintaining real-time data flow between components.

## üìã STEP 1: Environment Setup & Understanding

### Local Development Environment
Before coding begins, we need to set up a proper development environment with all necessary tools. This includes:

- **Node.js & npm**: The foundation for running JavaScript applications
- **LM Studio**: Local LLM runner that will power our AI capabilities
- **Git**: For version control and collaboration

```bash
# Install Node.js 18+, Git
# Download and install LM Studio from https://lmstudio.ai/

# Select and download a suitable model in LM Studio
# Models like Mistral or Llama2 provide a good balance of performance and efficiency
```

### Project Foundation
We'll use Next.js with the App Router to create a modern, performant application with server components.

```bash
# Create Next.js project with all modern features enabled
npx create-next-app@latest ai-planning-assistant
# Choose: TypeScript=Yes, ESLint=Yes, Tailwind=Yes, src/=Yes, App Router=Yes

cd ai-planning-assistant

# Install core dependencies
npm install convex langchain @langchain/community @langchain/ollama

# Install integration dependencies - these can be added incrementally as needed
npm install googleapis google-auth-library
```

### Understanding the Dependencies
- **convex**: Real-time database with automatic sync capabilities
- **langchain**: Framework for building LLM applications
- **@langchain/core**: Core LangChain functionality for working with LLMs
- **googleapis**: For future calendar integration features

## üìã STEP 2: Convex Backend Architecture

### Database Design Principles
Convex serves as our backend database and API layer. It offers several advantages:

- Real-time data synchronization
- Serverless functions for business logic
- Automatic scaling and optimization

The database schema will focus on two main concepts:
1. **Tasks**: Individual activities planned for the user
2. **Goals**: Higher-level objectives that generate multiple tasks

### Schema Implementation
When implementing the schema, we'll define:
- Clear table relationships
- Strong type safety with TypeScript
- Appropriate validation rules

```typescript
// Sample schema outline - will be implemented in convex/schema.ts
import { defineSchema, defineTable } from "convex/server";
import { v } from "convex/values";

export default defineSchema({
  tasks: defineTable({
    // Task properties with validation
  }),
  
  goals: defineTable({
    // Goal properties with validation
  }),
});
```

### Backend Functions
We'll implement several function types:
- **Mutations**: For creating and updating data
- **Queries**: For retrieving data with automatic reactivity
- **Actions**: For complex operations and external API calls

These functions will form the API that our frontend interacts with.

## üìã STEP 3: AI Integration Strategy

### Local LLM Integration
LM Studio provides local AI processing without sending data to external services. This approach offers:

- **Privacy**: User goals and plans remain on their device
- **No API costs**: Eliminating the need for OpenAI or other API subscriptions
- **Offline operation**: Works without internet connection

### Prompt Engineering
The system will rely on carefully designed prompts to:
1. Extract actionable tasks from general goals
2. Assign appropriate time allocations
3. Prioritize activities based on context
4. Create realistic schedules that avoid overcommitment

### Architecture for AI Processing
We'll create a middleware layer that:
1. Receives user goals from the frontend
2. Formats effective prompts for the LLM
3. Processes and validates the LLM's response
4. Returns structured task data ready for storage

---

## üìã STEP 4: Incremental Tool Integration Plan

### Phase 1: Core Planning System
Build the essential planning functionality with:
- Goal input interface
- AI task generation
- Basic weekly calendar view
- Task management (create, edit, delete)

### Phase 2: Calendar Integration
Add the ability to sync with external calendars:
- Google Calendar API integration
- Import existing calendar events
- Export AI-generated tasks to calendar
- Conflict detection and resolution

### Phase 3: Productivity Tools
Enhance the system with additional productivity features:
- Time tracking capabilities
- Progress monitoring
- Reminder notifications
- Performance analytics

### Phase 4: Collaboration Features
Add team-oriented capabilities:
- Shared projects and goals
- Task delegation
- Team calendar view
- Permission management

---

## üìã STEP 5: Front-End Architecture

### Component Structure
We'll organize components using:
- **Atomic design principles**: Building from atoms to pages
- **Component reusability**: Creating a consistent design system
- **Server and client components**: Leveraging Next.js App Router capabilities

### Key UI Elements
The interface will include:
1. **Goal Input Form**: For natural language goal entry
2. **Plan Visualization**: Interactive weekly calendar display
3. **Task Management**: Interface for viewing and editing tasks
4. **Settings**: Configuration options for AI behavior

### State Management
- Convex provides reactive queries that eliminate much of the traditional state management
- Local React state for UI-specific states
- Careful consideration of client vs. server state

---

## üìã STEP 6: Testing & Quality Assurance

### Test Coverage Plan
Implement tests at multiple levels:
- Unit tests for core functions
- Integration tests for feature flows
- End-to-end tests for critical user journeys

### Testing Tools
- Jest for unit testing
- React Testing Library for component testing
- Playwright for end-to-end testing

### Quality Metrics
- Type safety coverage with TypeScript
- Automated linting and formatting
- Performance benchmarks for critical operations

---

## üìã STEP 7: Deployment Strategy

### Local Development Environment
```bash
# Running the complete stack locally
# Terminal 1: Start LM Studio and expose API endpoint (typically at http://localhost:1234)
# Launch LM Studio application and start the local server

# Terminal 2: Start Convex
npx convex dev

# Terminal 3: Start Next.js
npm run dev
```

### Production Deployment Options
- **Vercel**: For hosting Next.js frontend
- **Convex Cloud**: For database and backend functions
- **User's local machine**: For running LM Studio (no cloud deployment needed)

1. **Week 1**: Environment setup, schema design, basic UI
2. **Week 2**: AI integration, core planning features
3. **Week 3**: Calendar integration, testing
4. **Week 4**: UI polish, documentation, deployment

- No sensitive data transmitted to third parties

### Performance Optimization
- Efficient prompt design to minimize LLM processing time
- Optimized database queries using Convex indexes
- Lazy loading of UI components

### Extensibility
The system is designed for easy extension through:
- Modular architecture
- Clear API boundaries
